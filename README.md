# Project Repo

This repo contains the files used to conduct the experiments throughout the project.
JTT includes JTT files.
BASS includes BASS files.

The files outside these folders are either from the original Meta repo for LLaMA 3 - this project started with that. We keep the instructions below for you to be able to run the pre-trained model if you wish. This is how we obtained base model results.

A lot of the files are redundant but demostrate some of the testing not shown in the report or presentation. I have kept quite a lot (although not the results as there were hundreds of messy files).

The shell run_script files show an example of how I ran the code.


## Download

In order to download the model weights and tokenizer, please visit the [Meta Llama website](https://llama.meta.com/llama-downloads/) and accept our License.

Once your request is approved, you will receive a signed URL over email. Then run the download.sh script, passing the URL provided when prompted to start the download.

Pre-requisites: Make sure you have `wget` and `md5sum` installed. Then run the script: `./download.sh`.

Keep in mind that the links expire after 24 hours and a certain amount of downloads. If you start seeing errors such as `403: Forbidden`, you can always re-request a link.

### Access to Hugging Face

We are also providing downloads on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama), in both transformers and native `llama3` formats. To download the weights from Hugging Face, please follow these steps:

- Visit one of the repos, for example [meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct).
- Read and accept the license. Once your request is approved, you'll be granted access to all the Llama 3 models. Note that requests used to take up to one hour to get processed.
- To download the original native weights to use with this repo, click on the "Files and versions" tab and download the contents of the `original` folder. You can also download them from the command line if you `pip install huggingface-hub`:

```bash
huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct --include "original/*" --local-dir meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct
```

- To use with transformers, the following [pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/pipelines) snippet will download and cache the weights:

  ```python
  import transformers
  import torch

  model_id = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct"

  pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model="meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct",
    model_kwargs={"torch_dtype": torch.bfloat16},
    device="cuda",
  )
  ```

## Quick Start

You can follow the steps below to quickly get up and running with Llama 3 models. These steps will let you run quick inference locally. For more examples, see the [Llama recipes repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama-recipes).

1. In a conda env with PyTorch / CUDA available clone and download this repository.

2. In the top-level directory run:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
3. Visit the [Meta Llama website](https://llama.meta.com/llama-downloads/) and register to download the model/s.

4. Once registered, you will get an email with a URL to download the models. You will need this URL when you run the download.sh script.

5. Once you get the email, navigate to your downloaded llama repository and run the download.sh script.
    - Make sure to grant execution permissions to the download.sh script
    - During this process, you will be prompted to enter the URL from the email.
    - Do not use the “Copy Link” option but rather make sure to manually copy the link from the email.

6. Once the model/s you want have been downloaded, you can run the model locally using the command below:
```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 example_chat_completion.py \
    --ckpt_dir Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct/ \
    --tokenizer_path Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct/tokenizer.model \
    --max_seq_len 512 --max_batch_size 6
```
**Note**
- Replace  `Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct/` with the path to your checkpoint directory and `Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct/tokenizer.model` with the path to your tokenizer model.
- The `–nproc_per_node` should be set to the [MP](#inference) value for the model you are using.
- Adjust the `max_seq_len` and `max_batch_size` parameters as needed.
- This example runs the [example_chat_completion.py](example_chat_completion.py) found in this repository but you can change that to a different .py file.

## Inference

Different models require different model-parallel (MP) values:

|  Model | MP |
|--------|----|
| 8B     | 1  |
| 70B    | 8  |

All models support sequence length up to 8192 tokens, but we pre-allocate the cache according to `max_seq_len` and `max_batch_size` values. So set those according to your hardware.

### Pretrained Models

```
torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 example_text_completion.py \
    --ckpt_dir Meta-Llama-3-8B/ \
    --tokenizer_path Meta-Llama-3-8B/tokenizer.model \
    --max_seq_len 128 --max_batch_size 4
```

### Instruction-tuned Models

```
torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 example_chat_completion.py \
    --ckpt_dir Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct/ \
    --tokenizer_path Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct/tokenizer.model \
    --max_seq_len 512 --max_batch_size 6
```
